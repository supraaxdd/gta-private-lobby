# GTA Private Lobby

## Disclaimer
This script will suspend and resume GTA automatically after 10 seconds. This GTA bug allows you to create a private lobby which appears as a public server, allowing you to resupply your businesses, and other activities as such that would only be available on a public lobby, like this was a private lobby. Please do note that people may start joining after sometime, however, you may run the script again and you should be able to continue in a new "private" lobby.

### Setup
The following steps can be used to setup the script and get it running within minutes!
All the executables that usually need to be downloaded with the batch script have been placed in the repository for convenience.

1) Download the code in this repository via git (`git clone https://github.com/supraaxdd/gta-private-lobby.git`) or download the code from the repository page. Please note that if you want to move the script, you have to move the executable file to the SAME FOLDER as the batch script
2) **RUN THE BATCH SCRIPT, NOT THE EXECUTABLE (.exe) FILE!!!** Note that the first time you run the script, you will get a EULA agreement. This is a one time thing, simply accept it and proceed.
3) Let the script run. *Note that when this script is running, you will not be able to enter GTA. This is intentional.*
4) Enjoy the free lobby!
