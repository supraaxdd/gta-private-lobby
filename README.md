# GTA Private Lobby

## Disclaimer
This script will suspend and resume GTA automatically after 10 seconds. This GTA bug allows you to create a private lobby which appears as a public server, allowing you to resupply your businesses like this was a private lobby. Please do note that people may start joining after sometime, however, you may run the script again and you should be able to continue in a new "private" lobby.

### Setup
The following steps can be used to setup the script and get it running within minutes!
Please note, this requires a prerequisite download.

1) Download [pstools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/pstools)
2) You only need to extract the `pssuspend.exe` file. **MAKE SURE YOU EXTRACT THIS FILE TO THE PROJECT DIRECTORY! YOU WILL ALSO HAVE TO KEEP THE SCRIPT IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE `pssuspend.exe` FILE, SHOULD YOU DECIDE TO MOVE IT!**
3) When you run this script for the first time, you will get a EULA agreement. This is a one time thing, simply accept it and proceed.
4) Let the script run. *Note that when this script is running, you will not be able to enter GTA. This is intentional.*
5) Enjoy the free lobby!
